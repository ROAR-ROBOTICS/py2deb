# flake8 3.0.0 drops explicit support for Python 2.6:
# http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/release-notes/3.0.0.html
flake8 < 3.0.0 ; python_version < '2.7'

# flake8-docstrings 1.0.0 switches from pep257 to pydocstyle and I haven't been
# able to find a combination of versions of flake8-docstrings and pydocstyle
# that actually works on Python 2.6. Here's the changelog:
# https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8-docstrings/blob/master/HISTORY.rst
flake8-docstrings < 1.0.0 ; python_version < '2.7'

# pyflakes 2.0.0 drops Python 2.6 compatibility:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/blob/master/NEWS.txt
pyflakes < 2.0.0 ; python_version < '2.7'

# pytest 3.3 drops Python 2.6 compatibility:
# https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/changelog.html#pytest-3-3-0-2017-11-23

# A build failure [1] alerted me to the fact that python-debian has dropped
# Python 2.6 support. Couldn't find a changelog so not sure if this is
# intentional, but some trial and error confirmed that 0.1.32 works whereas
# 0.1.33 does not.
#
# [1] https://travis-ci.org/paylogic/py2deb/jobs/456368291
python-debian < 0.1.33 ; python_version < '2.7'

# tox 3.0.0 drops Python 2.6 compatibility:
# https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v3-0-0-2018-04-02
tox < 3.0.0

# virtualenv release 16.0.0 drops Python 2.6 compatibility:
# https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/changes/
# Gotcha: Because we use 'tox' running on Python 2.7 to create a Python 2.6
# virtual environment, we can't constrain to python_version < '2.7'!
virtualenv < 16.0.0

# wheel 0.30.0 drops Python 2.6 compatibility:
# https://pypi.org/project/wheel
wheel < 0.30.0 ; python_version < '2.7'
